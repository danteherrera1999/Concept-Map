A consequence of this is that if you created a set from $0$ to $p-1$ for a given prime $p$, multiplying each element of the set by a scale factor $a$ with $gcd(a,p)=1$ would again require that no previously noncongruent $(mod \\ p)$ integers would become congruent after being scaled by a factor of $a$. Since the initial set contains no congruent $(mod \\ p)$ elements, so too must the scaled set. Since we began with the set containing the maximum number of integers without having a pair of congruent $(mod \\ p)$ integers, it will result in the same exact set $(mod \\ p)$ after being scaled.\n","tags":["Proposition","Number Theory"],"connections":[26,23],"x":-270,"y":-210,"width":60,"height":60},{"id":28,"name":"Fermat's Little Theorem","description":"If $a$ is an integer and $p$ is a prime which does not divide $a$, then $a^{p-1} \\equiv 1 \\ (mod \\ p)$ \n\nAlternate Formation:\nIf $a$ is a natural number and $p$ is a prime which does not divide $a$, then $a^p\\equiv a \\ ( mod \\ p)$\n\nExplanation:\nFrom the modular cancellation law we learned that the set $\\{0,1,...,p-1\\}$ is congruent with itself $(mod \\ p)$ after being scaled by $a$ any number of times as long as $gcd(a,p)=1$. Since $0$ will always remain $0$ after being scaled by any $a$, we can remove it from the set and still have that $\\{1a,2a,...,(p-1)a\\} \\equiv \\{1,2,...,p-1\\}$. Starting with $1 \\equiv 1 \\ (mod \\ p)$ we begin by multiplying the left and right side by congruent pairs (as per the properties of modular arithmetic) until we are left with $a*2a*...*(p-1)a \\equiv 1*2*...*(p-1) \\ (mod \\ p)$. Factoring (not cancelling) a $2$ out from both sides we get $2(a^2*3a*...*(p-1)a) \\equiv 2(3*...*(p-1))$. Since $p$ is prime and by definition $2 \\lt p$, $gcd(2,p)=1$ and it can now be cancelled from both sides via the modular cancellation law. We can continue this process for every term until we are left with $a^{p-1} \\equiv 1 \\ (mod \\ p)$\n\nAlternate Proof:\nLet $k$ be some natural number and $p$ be some prime which does not divide $a$. Assume that $k^p \\equiv k \\ (mod \\ p)$. Now consider the case of $(k+1)^p$. By the binomial theorem, $(k+1)^p=\\sum\\limits_{m=0}^{p}\\binom{p}{m}k^m$. Recall that $\\binom{p}{m}=\\frac{p!}{m!(p-m)!}$ For the $m=0$ and $m=p$ cases this expression reduces to $\\frac{p!}{p!}=1$. The binomial coefficient for every other term has a numerator that is a factor of $p$, but the denominator (being a product only of primes less than $p$) is not. This means the total coefficient will be a factor of $p$, and thus congruent with $p$. Thus $(k+1)^p \\equiv k^p + 0 + 0 +...+0+1 \\ (mod \\ p)$ and therefore, $(k+1)^p \\equiv k^p+1 \\ (mod \\ p)$ Our inductive assumption told us that $k^p \\equiv k \\ (mod \\ p)$. Adding $1 \\ (mod \\ p)$ to both sides of our inductive assumption yields $k^p+1 \\equiv k + 1 \\ (mod \\ p)$, and thus $(k+1)^p \\equiv k + 1 \\ (mod \\ p)$. Thus, the assumption of the $k$ case implies the $k+1$ case. Finally, plugging in $k=1$ yields $1^p \\equiv 1 \\ (mod \\ p)$ which of course is true, implying that all subsequent cases are true.","tags":["Theorem","Number Theory"],"connections":[27,24,49],"x":-210,"y":-390,"width":60,"height":60},{"id":29,"name":"Prime Number Theroem","description":"$\\pi (N) \\approx \\frac{N}{ln(N)}$\n\nI.E.

The intuition for the reals is that the number $a$ and its additive inverse essentially create a bounding box, and for $\\lvert a \\rvert$ to be less than $b$, it must be that the entire bounding box for $a$ lies within the bounding box for $b$, and therefore so does $a$. Abstractly, \"$b \\gt a$\" means that $b$ plus the additive inverse of $a$ is in the positive subset $P$. Since $\\mathbb{F}$ is closed under $+$, $c=b-a$ is defined for every $a,b \\in \\mathbb{F}$, and since every such $c$ must either be in $P$ or not in $P$, we use this property to derive the ordering of the set.

In other words, $S \\subseteq (-n_k,n_k)$. This is the definition of bounded.\nS is closed:\nFor contradiction, assume that $S$ is open. This means for any point $x \\in S$, there must be some $\\delta \\gt 0$ such that the $\\delta-neighborhood \\subseteq S$. In other words, there must be some $a_1,a_2,a_3,...,a_n$ that approaches $x$, i.e. $a_n\\to x$ and all $a_n \\in S$. Now let some open set be $(-\\infty, x - \\frac{1}{n}) \\cup (x + \\frac{1}{n},\\infty)$ and take the union of all of these sets for $n \\in \\mathbb{N}$. The union of all these sets simply equals $\\mathbb{R} \\\\ \\{x\\}$. And since $S$ is an open interval not including $x$, it must be in this union, that is $S \\subseteq \\bigcup\\limits_{n=1}^\\infty U_n$. So $\\bigcup\\limits_{n=1}^\\infty U_n$ is an open cover of $S$. But $S$ is compact, which means there must be some finite subcover. Since each open set in our cover is a subset of the next, we can just pick some $n_k$ such that $S \\subseteq U_k = (-\\infty, x - \\frac{1}{n_k}) \\cup (x+\\frac{1}{n_k},\\infty) $. But this implies that $S \\cap (x-\\frac{1}{n_k},x+\\frac{1}{n_k})=\\emptyset$. Finally, this shows that there could be no $(a_n) \\subseteq S$ such that $a_n \\to x$, since it could never get arbitrarily close to $x$ while also being outside of this interval.\nReverse proof:\nAssume that $S$ is closed and bounded. Let $F$ be some open cover of $S$. For each $x \\in S$, define $S_x = S \\cap (-\\infty, x)$ and let $B = \\{x: F $ contains a finite subcover of $S_x \\}$. Since S is closed and bounded we know that $sup(S)= M \\in S$ and $inf(S) = L \\in S$. Since $S_L = \\{L\\}$ and there is clearly a set $U$ in $F$ which contains ${L}$, we know that $L \\in B$. If we can show that $M \\in B$ then we are done. Assume then for a contradiction that $M \\notin B$. This means that $x \\lt M$ for all $x \\in B$. $B$ is thus a nonempty subset of $\\mathbb{R}$ which is bounded above, which by completeness, means it must have some $sup(B) = T$. By the definition of $B$ There must be some finite subcover in $F$ which includes $S_T$, and hence some open set $U_T \\in F$ which includes $\\{T\\}$. But $U_T$ is an open set which means there must exist some $\\delta$ for which $(T-\\delta,T+\\frac{\\delta}{2}] \\subseteq (T-\\delta,T+\\delta) \\subseteq U_T$. Hence the finite subcover of $F$ which contains $S_T$ must also contain $S_{T+\\frac{\\delta}{2}}$. If $T+\\frac{\\delta}{2}$ is in $S$, then it must therefore also be in $B$, which contradicts the fact that $T=sup(B)$. The only value of $T$ for which this contradiction does not occur is $T=M$, which of course means that a finite subcover of $F$ exists which contains $S_M=S$, and therefore $S$ is compact.","tags":["Theorem"],"connections":[129],"x":2370,"y":-390,"width":60,"height":60}]}
