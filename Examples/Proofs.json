Imagine buckets from $0$ to $n-1$, if you had a vertex with either $0$ or $n-1$ edges, the other bucket would no longer be possible to fill. Likewise, filling each bucket removes another bucket from being filled, until you have 1 remaining vertex, which of course must share an edge count with another vertex as a result.","tags":["Proposition"],"connections":[6,4],"x":-1050,"y":390,"width":60,"height":60},{"id":6,"name":"Graph","description":"A graph is a collection of points, called vertices, with a collection of line segments, called edges, each of which connect two vertices.
